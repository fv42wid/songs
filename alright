i got a feeling you know when it hits you
the sky is my ceiling and everything is
gonna be alright
you make me believe it i know that you mean it
sometimes i see that everything is 
gonna be alight

tired eyes 
talking bout fantasies 
you know i wanna hear your dreams
i wanna know everything you see
you make me smile
it makes me feel like

happy days
turning into better nights
you’ll see how it’s worth the fight
if you stay you may find that i just might
make it worth your while
i’ll make you feel

to do…
double intro time
try a bass solo before second verse, solo the last piano buh bah
bring down level on the chorus piano part
try bass lead in to chorus
finish loop after solo
try adding one more line to end of verse
