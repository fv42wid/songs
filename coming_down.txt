it's coming down
it's coming down
the people have risen
you're over now
it's our time now
we are free from your prison

it's coming down
it's coming down
it's a fine day for your fall
you're over now
it's our time now
you can't stop the movement
deep inside you knew it
it's coming down

as empires rise, a chosen few
with watchful eyes, look down on you
it's the way, they control
that makes you stand, when you hear the bell toll
you've got to wake up, you've got to open your eyes
you've got to make it, and they'll start to realize.

[chorus]

the view up there, it must be beautiful
you look down, it's just the usual
the seed's been planted

beautiful
usual

time 
climb
