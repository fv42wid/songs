it's coming down
it's coming down
you're over now
it's our time now
we've waited for this time
when we get our chance to shine

it's coming down
it's coming down
you're over now
it's our time now
you can't stop the movement
deep inside you knew it
it's coming down

as empires rise, a chosen few
with watchful eyes, look down on you
it's the way, that they rule
that makes you think [rhyme with rule]

the view up there, it must be beautiful
you look down, it's just the usual
the seed's been planted

beautiful
usual

time 
climb
