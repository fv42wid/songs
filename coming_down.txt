chorus

it's coming down
it's coming down
you can't stop it
you want to unlock it

you're over now
it's our time now
i can see it's over
now

verse

as empires rise, a chosen few
with watchful eyes, 
look down on you, they control
every thing you do

[change chords here]
every step you take, every move you make

it's the way, they control
that makes you stand, when you hear the bell toll
(you've) got to wake up, (you've got to) open your eyes
you've got to make it, and they'll start to realize.

[chorus]






it's a fine day 
for your fall
you're over now
it's our time now
you can't stop the movement
deep inside you knew it
it's coming down



the view up there, it must be beautiful
you look down, it's just the usual
the seed's been planted

beautiful
usual

time 
climb
