do you remember a time
you could look to the sky and see your whole life
when your problems seemed big but they were so small
and your friends would stay out all night

just the look in your eyes
i remember and it makes me smile
when I’m down or i’m feeling something
i think back to when we were causing trouble


i wanna run, i wanna stay up all night
i'd do anything if it feels alright
i wanna..
