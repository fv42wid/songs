that tall hot blonde she changed me
she made me
the man I want to be



...
she was lining up shots
she was dancing around
she was looking so hot
i could tell she was down

had me watching her moves
and she was watching me fall
made me think I was smooth
but she had me at her beck and call

bridge to chorus
but all she did was break my heart
yada yada
