tired, worked my hands to the bone
if i could just get home
inspired to do something more
something never done before
i was born to be great
i was born to be free, i just wanna be me

you work hard, you’re just trying to endure
but you’re never quite sure
people say you’re pretty tough
but it’s never quite enough
and you’re down on your knees
you were born to be free, tell me what you wanna be
