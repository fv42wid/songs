i have had time time to consider
the evidence (your testimony) and your guilty
for your sins, you must repent them
or face your fate

i have had time and your not worth it
you did not love me you made this bed
i bid you good night hope you sleep well


you push me i can't get mad
it makes me feel kind of bad
i know you see how it is
i've got no fucks left to give

i find you guilty, for these sins
these transgressions, will be noted
on your record, for future reference

i have had time to consider
your apology, and i find it
uncompelling, lacking reason

new verse

where's the whistle when you need it
the evidence is ever mounting
and i am finished forgive your sins
